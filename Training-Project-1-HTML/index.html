  <pre>
    Our death is our wedding with eternity.
    What is the secret? “God is One.”
    The sunlight splits when entering the windows of the house.
    This multiplicity exists in the cluster of grapes;
    It is not in the juice made from the grapes.
    For he who is living in the Light of God,
    The death of the carnal soul is a blessing.
    Regarding him, say neither bad nor good,
    For he is gone beyond the good and the bad
